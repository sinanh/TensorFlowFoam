A turbulence model built using a deep neural network trained in Tensorflow 1.15.

## Contents
1. `ML_RANS/`: A tutorial for setting up an artificial neural network surrogate for a linear eddy-viscosity RANS model.

2. `ML_LES/`: A tutorial for setting up an artificial neural network surrogate for dynamic Smagorinsky coefficient calculation (i.e., bypass test-filtering).

3. `IN_SITU/`: A tutorial for setting up a neural network training _from within_ OpenFOAM to avoid disk IO. **NOTE**: We have observed some training instances to suffer from segfaults due to impromper initial (randomized) choices for weights and biases (be careful). 

## Installation

The following steps will get you started with a data-driven turbulence model deployed in OpenFOAM 5. I am assuming you have already installed and successfully run OpenFOAM 5 prior to this. Also, this tutorial will be based on Linux (Ubuntu 18.04) at this point of time.

### Step 1: Install python environment

We suggest the creation of a new Python 3.6.9 virtual environment (either in conda or venv) and the installation of relevant packages for this tutorial using
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Download the Tensorflow C API

You can download the TensorFlow C API at `https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c`. Follow instructions there to install on your machine. This tutorial/model is designed for the **Linux CPU only** release. Briefly, the instructions to install (if you have root access) are:

1. `sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf (downloaded file)`
2. `sudo ldconfig`

and you are good to go. If you do not have root access and need to place the TensorFlow C API at an arbitrary location you may use the following steps:

1. `tar -C /path/to/api -xzf (downloaded file)`
2. `export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/api/lib`
3. `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/api/lib`

Note that steps 2 and 3 either need to be added to your `.bashrc` file or need to be executed each time a new terminal session is started. 

### Step 3: Test that C API is running using Test_TF_C code

After Step 2 is complete test that your API is configured correctly by executing the following code (which you can save in `hello_tf.cpp`
```
//Working on some tensorflow and c++ implementations

#include <stdio.h>
#include <tensorflow/c/c_api.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello from TensorFlow C library version %s\n", TF_Version());

  return 0;
}
```
by using 
1. `g++ hello_tf.cpp -ltensorflow`
2. `./a.out`
to obtain the following output
```
Hello from TensorFlow C library version 1.15.0
```
If you face an error here (perhaps due to not linking appropriately in the absence of root priveleges) try using:
```
g++ -I/path/to/api/include -L/path/to/api/lib hello_tf.cpp -ltensorflow
```
for step 2.

If you have reached this point - congratulations you are ready to use TensorFlow 1.15 *within* OpenFOAM 5. You may utilize the individual READMEs from `ML_RANS/`, `ML_LES` and `IN-SITU` (documentation for the latter two are in-progress) to construct a neural network based turbulence model for training/deployment in OpenFOAM.
